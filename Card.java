/**
 * A Card represents an immutable playing card. For example, a card object that
 * represents the five of hearts will always represent the five of hearts.
 * 
 * You need to define the appropriate instance fields and implement the
 * following methods.
 * 
 * You also need to define methods to allow Card objects to be compared for
 * equality, and some kind of useful toString method. Feel free/encouraged to
 * use the Source -> Generate... methods to generate these methods.
